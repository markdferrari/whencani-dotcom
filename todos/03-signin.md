# Sign In

I want a Google Signin button on all 3 sites

Standard Google button - 

Use DynamoDB as the primary database (this should be managed via SST config)

Only a single DynamoDB between all 3 sites - if a user signs in to one, their profile should be shared across sites.

## DB Schema

A NoSQL db schema that simply stores user details. No PII if at all possible.
